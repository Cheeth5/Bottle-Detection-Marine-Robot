# 🌊 Bottle Detection Marine Robot  

Welcome to the **Bottle Detection Marine Robot** project repository! This project demonstrates an innovative solution for environmental sustainability by using a marine robot capable of detecting and collecting plastic bottles from water bodies.  

---

## 🎯 **Project Overview**  

This project was developed for the **Forum DSI** conference, a globally recognized event for innovation and technology. The robot uses **machine learning** and **computer vision** to identify bottles in the water and performs the following tasks:  

1. **Detection**: Recognizes plastic bottles using a trained machine learning model.  
2. **Navigation**: Moves toward the detected bottle.  
3. **Grabbing**: Collects and stores the bottle.

## 🚀 **Features**  

- **Real-Time Object Detection**:  
  Utilizes a trained YOLOv5 model to detect bottles with high accuracy.  

- **Autonomous Navigation**:  
  The robot adjusts its movement dynamically to approach detected objects.  

- **Grabbing Mechanism**:  
  Equipped with a mechanical arm to securely grab and store bottles.  

- **Sustainability Focused**:  
  Aims to reduce pollution in water bodies by automating waste collection.
